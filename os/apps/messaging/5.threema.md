### Download
[Download](https://shop.threema.ch/download) the `.apk` but first we have to have the licence. Once we have, we can download the app. Verify if the `hash` of the app matches before install on the phone:
```bash
openssl dgst -sha256 Threema-4.8.apk
```
When we update the apk, in order to download the new version, we will need the `licence key`

In case, we cannot install the application with the android file manager, download [Simple File Manager Pro](https://www.simplemobiletools.com/filemanager)
