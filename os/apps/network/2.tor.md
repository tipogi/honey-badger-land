## Tor Browser
In the first install download the `.asc` file which is the signing key
```bash
wget https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/EF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290
gpg --import tor-code-signing.asc
# Trust completely the signing key
# The code of the signing key is EF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290
gpg --edit-key EF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290
# We will enter in the gpg console, trust the key
> trust
5
> q
```
### Installation
Verify signature of the downloaded files
```bash
gpg --verify tor*.xz.asc
```
Unpack the `.xz` file and move to a new folder
```bash
tar -xf [TB archive]
mkdir ~/apps
# Or we can move using file manager UI
mv -rf ~/Downloads/tor/11.0.9/tor-browser-linux64-11.0.9_en-US ~/apps/
mv ~/apps/tor-browser-linux64-11.0.9_en-US ~/apps/tor-browser
```
Configure and run
```bash
cd tor-browser
./start-tor-browser.desktop --register-app
```

## Tor Proxy
In some applications as `electrum`, we need to connect through *tor proxy* and for that we need to install the proxy. In others cases, opening the browser will be enough (example of `whirlpool-gui`, usually it goes through browser which is the default configuration)
### Installation
```bash
# Check the architecture of the CPU
dpkg --print-architecture
# Install some dependencies
sudo apt install apt-transport-https
# Create a new file to download the repositories
cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
# Before write in the new file check the distrubution and change for the output that we get
lsb_release -c
sudo vim tor.list
```
Add this content in the file
```bash
deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org <DISTRIBUTION> main
deb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org <DISTRIBUTION> main
```
Download the GPG key to verify the future download packages. Should do as `root`
```bash
wget -qO- https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | gpg --dearmor | tee /usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null
```
Install tor and tor debian keyring
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tor deb.torproject.org-keyring
```
Check if installation was succesful
```bash
tor --version
# Check if tor is listening as proxy in 9050 port
ss -nlt
```
