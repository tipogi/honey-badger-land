**IMPORTANT!**: Follow the steps, do not download till reach that step, if not the hash check will output an error
### Signature (Craig Raw)
Import the keys that sign the release app:
```bash

# Trust the key
gpg -k
gpg --edit-key D4D0D3202FC06849A257B38DE94618334C674B40
# trust level: 5
> trust
```
### Verify the app

wget  https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow/releases/download/[version_number]/sparrow-[version_number]-manifest.txt.asc
gpg --verify sparrow-[version_number]-manifest.txt.asc
```

### Download

wget https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow/releases/download/[version_number]/sparrow_[version_number]-1_amd64.deb
sha256sum --check sparrow-[version_number]-manifest.txt --ignore-missing
```

### Install app and uDev rules
Click in the `.deb` file:
```bash
#Install uDev rules with root rights
sudo /tmp/hwi-2.0.29876305314202057175.tmp installudevrules
```

### Connect to electrs with Raspibolt
In the node, go to the *torrc hidden service* and check the onion address:
```bash
sudo su
cat /var/lib/tor/electrs_service/hostname
```
Sparrow has already a built-in `tor proxy library` (connected through SOCKS, port 9050 so, we might need to stop tor service, if not it throws an error). This is the configuration to connect through tor proxy:

### Connect using RoninDojo
RoninDojo comes with Electrum Rust Server (Electrs) by default as an indexer. Using Electrs still allows for performant use of Samourai Wallet but also facilitates the connection to any othe wallet application that opts to use an Electrum Server as their backend.
