# Sparrow Wallet

**IMPORTANT!**: Follow the steps, do not download till reach that step, if not the hash check will output an error

## Signature

Import the keys to sign the release app. With that we will verify the ownership of the application and the application has not been compromised or in other way, that the application is not fake one. The developer of the application is **Craig Raw** and here if not the download page of [sparrow][https://sparrowwallet.com/download/]

```bash
curl https://keybase.io/craigraw/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
# Trust the key
gpg -k
gpg --edit-key D4D0D3202FC06849A257B38DE94618334C674B40
# trust level: 5
> trust
```

## Verify the app

The version number (below as `[version_number]`) has to be the last one, you can check in its releases [page](https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow/releases). Verify the app app with the hash

```bash
# Download the files to verify the application
wget https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow/releases/download/[version_number]/sparrow-[version_number]-manifest.txt
wget  https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow/releases/download/[version_number]/sparrow-[version_number]-manifest.txt.asc
gpg --verify sparrow-[version_number]-manifest.txt.asc
```

```

## EXTRA: Connect to your own node

This step is not going to be necessary if you want to play with testnet network

### Connect sparrow to the node

As we say in [[nodes/readme |nodes section]], it is really important to connect to one node your wallet to keep the **privacy** of honey badger coins and yours. Follow to steps to connect the wallet to some node.

#### Connect to electrs with Raspibolt

In the node, go to the *torrc hidden service* and check the onion address:

```bash
sudo su
cat /var/lib/tor/electrs_service/hostname
```

Sparrow has already a built-in `tor proxy library` (connected through SOCKS, port 9050 so, we might need to stop tor service, if not it throws an error). This is the configuration to connect through tor proxy:

#### Connect using RoninDojo

RoninDojo comes with Electrum Rust Server (Electrs) by default as an indexer. Using Electrs still allows for performant use of Samourai Wallet but also facilitates the connection to any othe wallet application that opts to use an Electrum Server as their backend.
