### Check python3 and pip3 versions
```bash
# The version has to be higher than 3.7, actually 3.9.7
$ python3 --version
$ python3 -m pip --version
```
### Install dependencies
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5 libsecp256k1-0 python3-cryptography
```

### Download and verify
```bash
wget https://download.electrum.org/4.2.1/Electrum-4.2.1.tar.gz
gpg --verify Electrum-4.2.1.tar.gz.asc
# Install dependencies to install in the machine
 sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools python3-pip
```

### Desktop file
> Thinking that you have your own node and you care your privacy. If you are thinking to have your own node, check more info in [[citadel üèî/nodes/readme |node implementations]]

If we want to have the application icon in the machine search bar or the naviagation bar, we need to create a desktop file. Here, we are going to use [[electrum.desktop_raspibolt |raspibolt]] or [[electrum.desktop_ronin | ronin dojo]] node implementations to force the electrum application to connect just to that nodes. We do not want that electrum wallet will connect to third party nodes and leak the wallets data.

```bash
cd /usr/share/applications
# paste in that file the copied text from electrum.desktop
sudo vim electrum.desktop
# Add image to the icon. It has to have the same name as above file [icon]=xxxx. xxxx.png
cp [path_of_electrum_icon]/electrum.icon.png /usr/share/pixmaps
# Install the desktop file
sudo desktop-file-install electrum.desktop
```

### Hardware Wallets [](https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardware-linux.html)
Currently all hardware wallets depend on `hidapi`, to be able to build that, we need to install few packages. Update repositories and install dependencies:
```bash
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev
```
Install *setuptool* and *wheel*, that packages recommends trezor for *trezorctl* (see below link, trezorctl-commands)
```bash
$ pip3 install setuptools wheel 
```
#### Trezor T
##### sources
[trezorctl-commands](https://wiki.trezor.io/Using_trezorctl_commands_with_Trezor#Install_python-trezor): Conrol your trezor with *trezorctl*
[trezorctl-errors](https://forum.trezor.io/t/trezorct-does-not-work/7438/7): *trezorctl* compilation errors, python3
##### trezorctl 
Install python-trezor:
```bash
$ pip3 install trezor
```
Update your $PATH by running
```
$ source .profile
```
##### udev rules
Udev rules need to be set up on your system in order to interact with electrum
```bash
$ sudo groupadd plugdev
$ sudo usermod -aG plugdev $(whoami)
$ cd ~/Downloads
# Another source: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/tree/master/contrib/udev
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trezor/trezor-common/master/udev/51-trezor.rules
$ sudo cp ~/Documents/Citadel/files/electrum/udevrule/51-trezor.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
$ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
``` 
Now we are ready to use *trezorctl*
```bash
# Check if we contact our trezor using the cli
$ trezorctl ping "ahoy!"
# We use that command to wipe the seed from the device. Good practise for cold storage seeds
$ trezorctl wipe-device
```
##### problems
Sometimes, after some updates of the libraries, the *trezorctl* installation might be mess up and we can get this kind of error
```bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/me/.local/bin/trezorctl", line 7, in <module>
    from trezorlib.cli.trezorctl import cli
  File "/home/me/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/trezorlib/cli/__init__.py", line 25, in <module>
    from ..client import TrezorClient
  File "/home/me/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/trezorlib/client.py", line 24, in <module>
    from . import exceptions, mapping, messages, models
  File "/home/me/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/trezorlib/mapping.py", line 100, in <module>
    DEFAULT_MAPPING = ProtobufMapping.from_module(messages)
  File "/home/me/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/trezorlib/mapping.py", line 83, in from_module
    for entry in message_types:
TypeError: 'module' object is not iterable
```
To solve that issue, we need to force the installation of `trezorctl`
```bash
# Remove the currently installed version explicitly with
$ rm -r ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/trezorlib
# Force reinstall with
$ pip3 install --force-reinstall trezor
```
If that doesn't help, try to find out if there is no system version of trezorctl messing things up:
```bash
sudo apt remove python3-trezor
```
#### BitBox02
##### Installation
Interact with electrum installing the python library of bitbox
```bash
python3 -m pip install bitbox02
```
##### udev rules
Copy the files from the [udev rules](`https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/tree/master/contrib/udev`) repository and run the commands
```bash
sudo cp vault_path/apps/config/electrum/udevrule/53-hid-bitbox02.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo cp vault_path/apps/config/electrum/udevrule/54-hid-bitbox02.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```


#### ColdCard MK3
##### Installation
Install python library to interact with cold card device
```bash
$ python3 -m pip install ckcc-protocol
```
##### udev rules
Apply these rules by copying them to `/etc/udev/rules.d/` and notifying `udevadm`. Your user will need to be added to the `plugdev` group, which needs to be created if it does not already exist. [More info](`https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/tree/master/contrib/udev`)
```bash
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Coldcard/ckcc-protocol/master/51-coinkite.rules
$ sudo groupadd plugdev
$ sudo usermod -aG plugdev $(whoami)
$ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

##### Problems
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'click'
```bash
$ pip3 install click
```
##### Run coldcard-cli
```
$ ckcc
```

### Connect electrum to our electrs instance
Get the electrs *hidden service* in the node, this is for **raspibolt**:
```bash
sudo su
# Raspibolt implementation
cat /var/lib/tor/electrs_service/hostname
# To know in which port is listening the service
cat /etc/tor/torrc
```
If we access using **ronin dojo** connect with ssh and `Credentials (5) -> Electrs (3)`
IMPORTANT: We might need to install *tor proxy* to redirect the traffic from there, if not is does not stablish the connection. Go to [[2.tor | Tor Proxy]]
![[electrum-not-connected.png]]
Once we finish the installation, if the service is stopped, execute
```bash
sudo systemctl start tor
```
and open -> close application and we should get the blue bubble
![[electrum-connected.png]]
##### Check connection
Check if we connect to our node:
**Raspibolt**: `sudo journalctl -f -u electrs` on the node.
**RoninDojo**: Go to electrum console tab `View -> Show Console`. Once we have console tab in the UI, go and we should get the following info:
```bash
>>>
Welcome to your RoninDojo v1.14.1 Electrs Server!
>>>
```

## Connected!
Once electrum is connected to the electrs or bitcoin core, it is time to connect your HW or create your watch-only wallets. Go to wallets section
