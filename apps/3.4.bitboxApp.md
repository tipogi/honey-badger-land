# BitBox App
Go to [Bitbox](`https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox-wallet-app/releases`) web and download the public key (if it is the first time that we install) and the application
```bash
curl 'https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/1AA62C17C56D4275A54123209CD5646C0AD5161E' | gpg --import
# List all the keys and find the key fingerprint
gpg -k
gpgp --edit-key 1AA62C17C56D4275A54123209CD5646C0AD5161E
# trust the key
> trust
> 5
```
Now that we have the BitBox key, check the signature of the application but first download the `.deb` and `.asc` files
```bash
gpg --verify bitbox_4.32.0_amd64.deb.asc
```
Verify application sha256sum checksum
```bash
sha256sum bitbox_4.32.0_amd64.deb
```
### Connect to electrs
This is a privacy practise to make sure (I cannot asure that so *do not trust, verify*) to not leak any information of our wallet.
**Before connect anything**, open the application, go to *settings* and activate `tor proxy` (127.0.0.1:9050). As we say in [[3.3.electrum-wallet | electrum app]] *tor proxy* has to be running
```bash
sudo systemctl start tor
```
Get the electrs *hidden service* in the node, this is for **raspibolt**:
```bash
sudo su
# Raspibolt implementation
cat /var/lib/tor/electrs_service/hostname
# To know in which port is listening the service
cat /etc/tor/torrc
```
If we access using **ronin dojo** connect with ssh and `Credentials (5) -> Electrs (3)`.
Before establish the connection, close the application. When we open again, the application will connect through tor as a default connection. Now go to *settings* again, delete all the nodes in the list (also Litecoin) and test the connection with our node. We will need to add the host name and the listening port: *hostname:port*. First, get the certificate and after check connection. If everything works as expected, our connection will add in the node list.
