## Initial set up
Hydrate (add the seed) with **electrum** if the device does not have a seed. In **Sparrow**, we cannot hydrate the device because it throws an error if it does not contain the seed.
## Firmware
Access to [trezor github repository](`https://github.com/trezor/webwallet-data/tree/master/firmware/2`), always has to be `2` folder (in our case, Trezor T). We will use that folder also to check the hash of the new trezor firmware file.
### Preparation:
1.- Check if the `trezorctl` [library](https://pypi.org/project/trezor/) is up to date. If the version does not match or if we get some error running the second command, check [[3.3.electrum-wallet | electrum wallet manual]] 
```bash
$ trezorctl version
# In that case, we are going to update
$ pip3 install -U trezor
# Check the device connection is successful
$ trezorctl ping "ahoy!"
```
When we choose the new firmware version from the list, in the url has to be `raw` not `blob` (important)
2.- Download **trezor-xx-bitcon-only.bin**. To get the right file, select the latest firmware and in the redirected page, hover over **download** button and copy the url to after download with `wget` command
![[download.png]]
```bash
# NOT install 'blob' url. ERROR
$ wget https://github.com/trezor/webwallet-data/blob/master/firmware/2/trezor-2.4.1-bitcoinonly.bin
# YES instal 'raw' url. SUCCESS
$ wget https://github.com/trezor/webwallet-data/raw/master/firmware/2/trezor-2.4.1-bitcoinonly.bin
```
**NOTE**: As we say above, if we download from `../blob/..` url, we will get the following error:
```bash
$ Unrecognized firmware image type
```
4.- After download, go back to the list and click in the selected firmware row, the second column (our case `feat(fw): add 2.4.1 and 1.10.2 versions`). There we can check the firmware fingerprint 
4.- Set the device in bootloader mode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVBiSFTx0qQ
Slide up and down the screen and connect the trezor
5.- Install the new firmware but first check the *firmware fingerprint* as we say above. 
![[fingerprint.png]]
6.- Next, run the firmware installation command and before confirm the installation in the device, it gives as output the fingerprint hash. Check and after that confirm in the device:
```bash
# 2.4.1
$ trezorctl firmware-update -f trezor-2.4.1-bitcoinonly.bin
# Once the hash of the file and the fingerprint of the bitcoinonly hash are the same, press in the device 'Yes'

```
## Passphrase
In **sparrow** we have an option to disable the passphare. Once we add a wallet in the application, at the bottom we have usb icon. If we navigate through that, we have toggle option. If it is active, it will disable and viceversa
## !Recovery
Above, we say that it is not possible to hydrate with **sparrow** so, we will do with **electrum**:
`File -> New -> Name -> Standard Wallet -> Use a hardware device -> Initialise device -> Passphrase -> Derivation Path`

![[2.standard_wallet.png]]
![[3.hw_device.png]]
![[4.select_device.png]]
![[5.initialise_device.png]]
![[6.configuration.png]]
**WARNING:** Never add the passphrase in the computer, always in the HW

![[8.derivation_path.png]]
##### Sparrow
Now, if we want to add our wallet in `sparrow` wallet (check [[1.BitBox | BitBox manual]])
`File -> New Wallet -> Connected hardware Wallet -> Import -> Apply`. The only step that it changes is the 3rd one which is `connected HW`
![[🏔 citadel/wallets/img/sparrow/trezor_hw/3.import.png]]
## Delete the seed
**This is a MUST in that HW because it can extract our seed in 15min**. To clear the seed and not keep the seed in the secure chip, run this commands
```bash
# Make sure if the computer detects the device
$ trezorctl ping "ahoy!"
# Clear the seed from the device
$ trezorctl wipe-device
```
